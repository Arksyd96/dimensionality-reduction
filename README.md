# Dimensionality reduction :
1. The curse of dimensionality refers often to modeling tasks with a lot of input features, which makes the task more harder and more challenging.
2. These techniques can be used in applied machine learning to simplify a classification or regression dataset in order to better fit a predictive model.
3. The casual data analyst work flow is generally constitued of 3 tasks :  
    - Dimensionality reduction (feature selection, feature extraction, linear algebra methods, projection methods, autoencoders. etc.).
    - Clustering (Hierarchical clustering, spatial clustering, K-means. etc.).
    - Classifying data (KNN, neural networks. etc.).

## High dimensionality problems
- Too many features means a larger model and slower learning phase.
- the more dimensions we have, the wider the search space becomes and slows the search task. The data we have often represent a small and non-representative sample of that space.
