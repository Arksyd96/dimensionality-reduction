# Dimensionality reduction :
1. The curse of dimensionality refers often to modeling tasks with a lot of input features, which makes the task more harder and more challenging.
2. These techniques can be used in applied machine learning to simplify a classification or regression dataset in order to better fit a predictive model.
3. The casual data analyst work flow is generally constitued of 3 tasks : 
  a. Dimensionality reduction (feature extraction, feature selection or dimensionality reduction).
  b. Clustering (Hierarchical clustering, spatial clustering, K-means. etc.).
  c. Classifying data (KNN, neural networks. etc.).
